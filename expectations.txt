Expectations in CMSC 100

In this class, I expect that I will be challenged with new concepts and ideas that will hopefully
cultivate my skill and understanding in Computer Science especially in the field of Web Development. 
Additionally, I expect that my ability to work with other people in the same project will become
better.

Marc Ian Aquino: I agree.
